## Tasks Completed

I was able to display the list of products with their details. Products can be added to the cart, with an updating total on the cart icon to the right of the header. The cart screen shows items added to the cart, the count for each time, price, and total price.

## Things I Would Update

I put placeholders in for the increment and decrement on the cart screen. Increment works in that it updates the total count behind the scenes, but I did not have time to update the logic for instant total cost update. Decrement was left as a TODO.

I did not have time to create a central theme object to be used across the app, and did not have time to implement something like a Toast or Snackbar to give some user feedback that an item was added other than the top right count.

I did not fully style the buttons for the products, nor the cards. Did not get many tests in place.
